# Turtle Race
Welcome to the Turtle Race project! This Python application provides a simple implementation of a turtle race game using the Turtle graphics library. With the Turtle Race, users can enjoy a fun and interactive race between multiple turtles, each controlled by a Python script.

## Features
1. **Interactive Turtle Graphics:** Utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create a visual representation of the race track and turtles.

2. **Multiple Turtles:** Allows users to race multiple turtles simultaneously, each represented by a unique color and controlled by a separate Python script.

3. **Randomized Movement:** Generates random movement for each turtle, simulating a race where the outcome is unpredictable.

4. **Race Visualization:** Displays the progress of each turtle as it moves along the race track, providing real-time updates on their positions.

5. **Race Winner:** Determines the winner of the race based on the first turtle to reach the finish line and declares the winner at the end of the race.

## Installation
To run the Turtle Race, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/Turtle-Race.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Turtle-Race

3. **Install Dependencies:** The Turtle graphics library is included in the Python standard library, so no additional dependencies need to be installed.

## Usage
1. **Start the Race:** Run the Python script to start the Turtle Race:

python main.py

2. **Race Progress:** Watch as the turtles move along the race track, with their progress visualized on the screen.

3. **Race Winner:** Once a turtle reaches the finish line, the race will end, and the winning turtle will be declared.

4. **Race Again:** You can choose to race the turtles again by restarting the Python script.

## Customization
1. **Number of Turtles:** Customize the number of turtles participating in the race by adjusting the Python scripts or command-line arguments.

2. **Race Track:** Modify the race track layout, length, and appearance to create different racing environments.

3. **Turtle Speed:** Adjust the speed of each turtle's movement to simulate different racing conditions, such as fast sprints or slow marathons.
